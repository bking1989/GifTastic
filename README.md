This is a code boot camp assignment that I made using basic JavaScript, jQuery, and the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/). The finished version of the assignment can be found [here](http://bking1989.github.io/GifTastic).

The task we were assigned was to take the API, learn how it worked, and develop a web application that registered search terms and made search queries that produced animated GIF images. This was done making AJAX calls using jQuery, and the results were produced using the JSON object that the calls brought back.

The web application itself is composed of several parts. The HTML and CSS front-end was composed using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for overall structure, along with [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons. From there, we included the API that we were assigned and other pieces of JavaScript to give the app functionality (e.g., scroll to top button).

In addition to utilizing API, there were other bonus features added, as well -- including a 'favorites' section and mobile accessibility (via Bootstrap).
